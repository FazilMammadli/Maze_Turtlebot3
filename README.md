# Turtlebot3 Maze Solver

## Overview

This project simulates a Turtlebot3 robot navigating a maze using ROS2. The robot utilizes an RGB camera for Aruco marker detection and a logical camera for identifying parts in the environment.

## Getting Started

To start the simulation, run the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo maze.launch.py

This will initialize the Gazebo environment with Turtlebot3 and its sensors.

## Node Descriptions
### MoveRobot Node
Moves the robot forward and stops when it is â‰¤ 0.4 meters from an Aruco marker, subscribing to odom and controlling movement through cmd_vel.

### ArucoMarkerHandler Node
Transforms detected Aruco markers to the odom frame, calculates the distance, and checks the marker's parameters for instructions.

### LogicalCameraHandler Node
Subscribes to mage/advanced_logical_camera/image and detects batteries, printing their positions in the odom frame.

## Instructions
- Start the simulation using the launch command.
- Run the MoveRobot node to move toward Aruco markers.

The ArucoMarkerHandler processes markers and controls robot movement.
Upon detecting the "end" marker, the LogicalCameraHandler prints the position of detected batteries.

## Dependencies
- ROS2 (Galactic)
- Turtlebot3 Packages
- OpenCV-contrib
